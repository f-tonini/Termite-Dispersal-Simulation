# Termite-Dispersal-Simulation

This repository has three folders: CA, IBM, and Tangible Landscape.
The IBM folder contains all R scripts used to develop the termite dispersal individual-based simulation presented in the research article published by:

Tonini, F., Hochmair, H. H., Scheffrahn, R. H., and DeAngelis, D. L. (2013). Simulating the spread of an invasive termite in an urban environment using a stochastic individual-based model. *Environmental Entomology*, 42 (3), pp. 412-423. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN12325] (http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/EN12325)

The CA folder contains all R scripts used to develop the termite dispersal individual-based simulation presented in the research article published by:

Tonini, F., Hochmair, H. H., Scheffrahn, R. H., and DeAngelis, D. L. (2014). Stochastic spread models: A comparison between an individual-based and a lattice-based model for assessing the expansion of invasive termites over a landscape. *Ecological Informatics*, 24, pp. 222-230 (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954114001277#)

Please check out the README files inside each main folder for more detailed instructions on how to set up and run the scripts.
